## Why This Project Exists

Traditional biology education relies heavily on 2D cross-sections that fail to convey the three-dimensional relationship between organs, blood supply networks, and waste pathways. 

**Kidney Anatomy Explorer** transforms static study into active learning:
* **Overcomes spatial confusion:** Helps students understand where the renal artery branches, how ureters connect to the bladder, and where the cortex sits relative to the medulla.
* **Reinforces conceptual models:** Connects structures directly with their biological purpose, memory tricks, and Class 11 examination syllabus points.
* **Encourages self-assessment:** Includes a real-time biology quiz to let students test their retention immediately.

---

## Key Features

* **Interactive 3D Kidney Model:** Fully rotatable, zoomable, and clickable 3D GLB model representing the human urinary system.
* **Dynamic Highlighting & Glow:** Clicked parts light up with customized neon glow outlines, emphasizing boundaries.
* **Anatomy Callout Labels:** High-fidelity 3D HTML annotations anchored to their exact anatomical coordinates, keeping labels clean and readable.
* **Class 11 Biology Focus:** Every explanation is tailored to school syllabus level, offering definitions, functions, and NCERT-aligned exam tips.
* **Quick View Buttons:** Effortlessly orbit to default viewpoints (e.g. Full system, Left Kidney close-up, Right Kidney close-up, Bladder) with one click.
* **Path Mode:** Step-by-step learning walkthrough tracing the path of blood filtration and urine elimination.
* **Interactive Quiz:** Standardized multiple-choice questions mixed with model-click tasks ("Click the correct part on the 3D model").
* **Unlimited Retry System:** Students learn through discovery; wrong attempts show helpful hints, and answers are never automatically revealed.
* **Compact Progress Dashboard:** Real-time metrics inside the quiz tracking questions completed, score, accuracy percentage, total attempts, wrong attempts, and current streak.
* **Parts Mastered Tracking:** Awards visual badges/chips for every anatomical part correctly identified in the quiz.
* **Consistent Deselection:** Click empty space on the 3D viewer in any mode (Learn, Path, or Quiz) to instantly clear highlights and labels.

## Learning Flow

1. **Explore (Learn Mode):** Spin and zoom the model. Click on any organ, blood vessel, or inner structure to open its descriptive biology panel.
2. **Trace (Path Mode):** Walk through the step-by-step guide outlining how blood enters the kidney, gets filtered, and leaves the body as urine.
3. **Assess (Quiz Mode):** Take a randomized quiz testing identification skills and anatomical pathways. Learn from wrong clicks using smart hints.
4. **Master (Progress Dashboard):** Complete the quiz to see your final score card, accuracy percentage, and list of parts mastered.

## Anatomy Parts Explorer

Clicking any part on the 3D model highlights it and opens a dedicated knowledge panel. Here is a breakdown of the parts detailed in the app:

| Organ / Structure | Core Biological Function | Class 11 NCERT Syllabus Connection |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Left & Right Kidney** | Filters nitrogenous wastes (urea) & maintains osmoregulation. | Primary excretory organs in human physiology. |
| **Renal Artery** | Brings oxygenated, waste-rich blood from aorta into kidneys. | Point of entry for filtration; high pressure supply. |
| **Renal Vein** | Carries deoxygenated, filtered blood back into systemic circulation. | Lacks urea compared to the renal artery. |
| **Left & Right Ureter** | Transports urine from renal pelvis to the urinary bladder. | Relies on peristaltic muscle movements for transport. |
| **Urinary Bladder** | Muscular sac that temporarily stores urine. | Detrusor muscle contraction triggers micturition. |
| **Renal Cortex** | Outer kidney layer containing glomeruli and convoluted tubules. | Site of ultrafiltration in nephrons. |
| **Renal Medulla** | Inner kidney layer organized into renal pyramids. | Concentration of urine (counter-current mechanism). |

2. **Select & Study:** Click directly on any organ or vessel (or select it from the list/quick view).
3. **Absorb Knowledge:** Read the right-side information panel detailing definitions, key functions, exam tips, and memory devices.
4. **Follow the Flow:** Toggle **Guided Tour** to watch the sequential path of blood entering, filtering, and leaving the system.
5. **Test Retention:** Take the built-in **Anatomy Quiz** to check preparation for biology exams.

## Learning Outcomes (Class 11 Physiology)
=======
## Learning Outcomes (Class 11 Physiology)

By using this explorer, students will master:
* **The anatomical pathway of urine:** Kidneys $\rightarrow$ Ureters $\rightarrow$ Urinary Bladder $\rightarrow$ Urethra.
* **The difference between cortex and medulla:** Understanding that the cortex forms the outer cap while the medulla contains the loop of Henle and collecting ducts.
* **Osmoregulation processes:** Identifying how the kidneys maintain water and salt equilibrium.
* **Renal circulatory loops:** Understanding why the renal artery carries nitrogenous waste while the renal vein carries clean blood.
